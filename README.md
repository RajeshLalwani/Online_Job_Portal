Jobify is a comprehensive, N-Tier web application built with ASP.NET Web Forms (C#) and SQL Server. It is a full-featured job portal designed specifically for the IT industry, connecting qualified tech professionals with top employers.

This application features a robust three-tier user system (Admin, Employer, and Job Seeker), each with a dedicated dashboard and functionalities. The entire platform is built with a focus on security, scalability, and a professional user experience.

ðŸš€ Technology Stack

Framework: ASP.NET 4.x (Web Forms)

Language: C#

Database: Microsoft SQL Server

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3.3.7, jQuery

Security: BCrypt.Net (for industry-standard password hashing)

UX: SweetAlert2 (for professional pop-ups and alerts)

ðŸ’» Core Technical Concepts Implemented

N-Tier Architecture: The project follows a logical separation of concerns (Presentation/UI, Business Logic, and Data Access).

Database Design: A relational database schema with Foreign Key constraints (ON DELETE CASCADE) to ensure data integrity.

Security:

Password Hashing: All user passwords are hashed using BCrypt.Net and never stored in plain text.

SQL Injection Prevention: All database queries are fully parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Session variables are used on every page and in the master pages to ensure users can only access pages appropriate for their role (Admin, Employer, Job Seeker).

Professional UI/UX:

Custom Pagination: Implemented PagedDataSource in C# to create professional, high-performance pagination for all Repeater controls (FindJobs, AppliedJobs, PostedJobs).

GridView Pagination: Utilized the built-in AllowPaging="true" feature for all Admin-side GridView controls.

Sticky Elements: Implemented position: sticky with CSS overrides to fix filter sidebars and profile cards on scroll.

Dynamic Content: All dashboards and reports are loaded dynamically from the SQL database.

Data Export:

Advanced C# functions to generate and download dynamic CSV reports from GridView data.

Successfully implemented logic to calculate and append "Grand Total" summary rows to the exported CSV files.
